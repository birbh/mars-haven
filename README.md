# mars-haven
Mars Haven is a full-stack web application that simulates a solar-storm-resilient human habitat on Mars. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the system models solar storm detection, radiation exposure, power management, and autonomous emergency responses, aligned with NASA’s Advanced Habitation Systems and space technology shortfalls.
